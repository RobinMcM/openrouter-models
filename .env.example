# OpenRouter Gateway Test UI Configuration
# ============================================

# REQUIRED: Your Gateway API key for authenticating with the OpenRouter Gateway backend
# This is NOT your OpenRouter.ai API key - it's the internal authentication key
# for the OpenRouter Gateway backend service running at the URL below.
# 
# This must match the INTERNAL_API_KEY set in the OpenRouter Gateway
# backend configuration (.env file on the gateway service).
# 
# To get this key:
# 1. Check the OpenRouter Gateway's .env file for INTERNAL_API_KEY value
# 2. Or contact your OpenRouter Gateway service administrator
# 3. This key is used for the X-API-Key header authentication
#
# Example: VITE_GATEWAY_API_KEY=my-secret-internal-key-123
VITE_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_internal_gateway_api_key_here

# OPTIONAL: OpenRouter Gateway API Base URL
# Default: http://134.209.184.66:8000
# Only change this if your gateway is hosted at a different URL
# 
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://134.209.184.66:8000

# ============================================
# Important Notes:
# ============================================
# 
# 1. The VITE_GATEWAY_API_KEY must match the INTERNAL_API_KEY in the 
#    OpenRouter Gateway backend configuration
# 
# 2. The VITE_ prefix is required by Vite to expose variables to browser code
#    (it's a security feature, not related to Vite itself)
# 
# 3. After creating/editing this file, restart your dev server:
#    npm run dev
# 
# 4. For production deployment (DigitalOcean), set these as 
#    environment variables in the platform dashboard
# 
# 5. Never commit the actual .env file to git - it contains secrets!
